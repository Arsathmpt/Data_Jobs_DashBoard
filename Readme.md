### 🔍 Key Insights
Based on the analysis, several key market trends were identified:

* **Salary Hierarchy:** **Senior Data Engineers** and **Senior Data Scientists** command the highest median salaries (~$156k/year). Interestingly, Senior Data Engineers often show a higher "hourly rate" efficiency in specific market outliers.
* **Platform Dominance:** **LinkedIn** is the overwhelming market leader for data job postings, vastly outperforming Indeed and ZipRecruiter for tech roles.
* **The "Remote" Reality:** For Senior Data Scientist roles, **Health Insurance (19%)** is explicitly mentioned in job descriptions more often than **Work From Home options (14%)**, challenging the narrative that senior tech roles are fully remote by default.
* **Market Contraction:** The data reveals a noticeable dip in job hiring volumes towards the end of 2024, signaling a competitive market cycle.
